# FPGA_SWD
fpga based SWD programmer

This setup works up to above the max of SWD spec (50Mhz)

currently verified working with at ATSAMD21G18 at 170 kB/sec. Programs the whole 256k in ~1.5sec.
That may be the max for that chip or maybe limited a bit by my hardware setup. I'll try again once I get a proper PCB.
